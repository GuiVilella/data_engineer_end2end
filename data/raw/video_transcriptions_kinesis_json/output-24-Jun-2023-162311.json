{"data": "{\"value\":\"0.0 Hey guys, and welcome back. So today's video, what we're gonna be doing is covering templates.6.1400000000000016.140000000000001 So templates are essentially a way to make your HTML actually look good and display it11.3611.36 on the screen. They're really nice in Django, because you can actually put your own Python15.8415.84 code and you can pass variables through to your templates, which means that you can make20.5220.52 dynamic HTML, which will change based upon whatever you pass to it, which is really nice.26.4826.48 So it's a really easy way to connect your kind of back end with your front end. And30.5230.52 that's one of the reasons why a lot of people obviously love Django is because of the fact33.7233.72 that you can do stuff like this. Now, I just want to quickly go over what I'm going to37.3637.36 be doing in the rest of the series. For some of you that were asking, I have plans to make41.2441.24 a video on how to add a proper sidebar to your website, how to do forms, because forms46.8846.88 are actually their own thing that are kind of complicated in Django. But I want to do50.050.0 a whole tutorial on that. I want to do user registrations, like login, register, sending55.7255.72 emails, all that kind of stuff. And then obviously, near the end of the series, we'll get into59.5659.56 more videos, longer videos where I'm not just doing features, but I'm kind of working on64.2864.28 development of the website, and actually probably hosting it using Heroku or something like69.4469.44 that and showing you guys how to actually deploy this, and hopefully for free online.74.6874.68 So if you guys are excited about that, please make sure you leave in a like on the video77.4877.48 and letting me know in the comments. And with that being said, let's get started with templates.81.8481.84 Now, if you remember where we left off, we had it. So essentially, we could view different86.2886.28 parts are different to do lists from our database by typing the integer into our bar. And that's91.6000000000000191.60000000000001 really all that we had. Now what I'm going to do in this video is create templates, which97.4897.48 will allow us to see our to do list on the screen in somewhat of a nice form. And in103.04103.04 future videos, I'll add bootstrap onto the website and start doing some custom CSS classes107.72107.72 and stuff. But for now, we're just gonna use plain HTML. And then we'll design and style112.48112.48 it all after because styling is really a pain and it takes a long time. So the first thing117.36117.36 I'm going to do is I want to create a homepage for my website. So right now we have this,122.68122.68 this page where you type a number, you can see it, we don't have any homepage. So let's125.52125.52 do that first. So I'm going to add a link here, which is just a blank string. And I'm130.64130.64 going to do views dot home, and name equals home, like this. And then inside of our views139.32139.32 file here, so views dot pi, I'll create a new function called home. So define home.144.72144.72 And then we'll have response, and we don't have any variables. So that's fine. And in149.32149.32 here, I'm just going to pass for right now as we're not finished coding that yet. Okay,153.48153.48 so templates. So right now, what we've been doing is we've been passing HTTP response159.72159.72 to our views. So that's the way that we're literally putting the HTML in here, like you164.16164.16 can see the tags right now, this is obviously not an efficient and not scalable way to make168.94168.94 a website. So what we're going to do is write our own HTML files, and then we're going to173.44173.44 load them up from here, actually render them and display them to the screen. So that's178.04178.04 what we have to do first. So the first step to do that is to actually create a directory182.26182.26 called templates inside of our application directory. So inside of main here, I'm going186.44186.44 to go to new folder and call this templates like so. So we're going main, now I got this192.4192.4 folder called templates. And now inside of this folder templates, I'm going to create196.32196.32 a new folder called main. Okay, now this might seem kind of weird how we have main and we202.64202.64 have templates and we have main, but it just the way the Django works, it's really weird,207.36207.36 I don't really want to explain it is you just need a folder inside here with the same name211.28211.28 as your application to load the templates. So that's what we're going to do. So now inside216.1216.1 of this folder is where we're going to put our actual HTML files. So let's create a new219.7219.7 file. And let's just start coding some HTML. And I'll talk about what this is going to225.56225.56 be compared to our other templates. So let's just set up an HTML document here, slash HTML.232.95999999999998232.95999999999998 And you know, let's save this as base dot HTML. And we'll talk about why I'm calling238.12238.12 this base in just a minute. So in here, now I'm going to add some head tags, like that,244.32244.32 and then we add some body tags, like that. So inside of our head, we'll simply just start249.95999999999998249.95999999999998 by adding a title, we will be adding a lot of other stuff into this later in the video.254.26254.26 But for now, we're just going to keep it nice and simple for demonstration purposes. So258.4258.4 I'm just going to call this Tim's website. And then inside of my body tags, I'm just262.52262.52 going to create a paragraph tag. And we'll just call this base template. Okay, so that's271.03999999999996271.04 all we're gonna do for now inside of that template. And let's create one more template276.28000000000003276.28000000000003 inside of here. And this one we're going to call home. Okay, so if I save this, and I280.84000000000003280.84000000000003 say home dot HTML, like that, and hit Enter, then in here, I'm going to talk now about287.8287.8 template inheritance. So a really nice thing with Django that makes building websites super293.0293.0 scalable is they have something called template inheritance. Now, right now, I've created298.20000000000005298.2 this template, and I've called it base dot html. And what I want this template to be302.88302.88 is, well, the base or the standard layout of every single one of my web pages. So for308.15999999999997308.15999999999997 example, okay, so let's just go to Instagram or something. And I can show you what I mean313.12313.12 by a base template in terms of this. So for example, a base template for Instagram is319.56319.56 this like bar up at the top, like every page you go to has this, or at least on the website,323.96323.96 right? It has this Instagram, it has a search bar, and then it has these icons. And then328.28328.28 obviously, it's going to be different depending on what page you are or what account you're331.03999999999996331.03999999999996 on what is going to show, but the base template would be like this top aspect, okay. So what336.08336.08 I want to do is create a base template, which will have something that will be on all of339.84339.84 my web page. So for example, on my actual website, if I go to tech with tim.net, you345.28345.28 can see that this up at the top here, this bar would be and actually, what do you call349.88349.88 it this logo thing as well is the base template, it's on every single page. So what I want355.32355.32 to do is make sure that I don't have to actually code that in to each HTML file that I make,360.64360.64 because think about it, if you have like hundreds of HTML files, I don't want to have to code364.52364.52 in that menu bar every time. So what we're going to do is we're going to code all the368.4368.4 stuff we want in always on the website in what's known as a base template. And then373.71999999999997373.71999999999997 we're going to inherit that template with just one line of code from all of our other377.48377.48 templates. This one's our base. And this is going to show up on all the pages unless we381.72381.72 override it from the child templates. So to actually inherit this base template, what388.12388.12 we do is we use the kind of the Django syntax here, which is we open and close a curly brace393.72393.72 it and then we put 2% signs like this and inside of here, we type extends and then we're399.92399.92 going to actually put in single quotes, main slash and then in this case, base dot HTML.408.16408.16 Now we just need to include main here because inside the main folder, and what this means412.1412.1 is just like in Java extending a class, you're going to extend this template, essentially416.44416.44 take everything from this template and use it here. Now, you're going to say, Well, how421.56421.56 do I change stuff in here? Well, we're going to get to that in a second. But let's demonstrate425.6425.6 this first. So now that we've done that, what we need to do is actually render and use these431.52000000000004431.52000000000004 templates. So I got to go back into views here. And right now you can see that all we're doing436.04436.04 is returning this HTTP response. So what I need to actually do is render my template.441.44441.44 So to do that, I'm going to remove HTTP response, we're actually not going to use that anymore,446.0446.0 we're going to use the keyword render. And then here, we're going to put response, which451.36451.36 lines up with this parameter here, we're going to put the template location. So in this case,457.08000000000004457.08000000000004 main slash, and we'll do base dot HTML for this one, okay. And then we'll do a comma,464.08000000000004464.08000000000004 and we're going to put a open dictionary, okay. Now I'll talk about this dictionary468.44468.44 more later. But for now, it's, we're just gonna leave it blank. Now we're gonna copy472.56472.56 this return, I'm gonna do the same thing in home, except instead of base, I'm going to476.28000000000003476.28 do home dot html. And that's actually going to be all we need to do to show these HTML483.08483.08 templates that I've created this pretty straightforward to do this. So now obviously, I'm going to487.03999999999996487.03999999999996 have to run my site. So let's, I got to activate my virtual environment one second here. And493.91999999999996493.91999999999996 we'll just do Python managed up high run server. Okay, so I didn't make any mistakes doesn't501.88501.88 seem like so let's load up Google here and hit enter. And now you can see that we've508.32508.32 directed to the homepage and we get base template. Okay. Now, so let's see how this worked. So515.52515.52 when we went in URLs, we didn't type any number. So we were passed just that empty string.521.48521.48 So what we did is we navigated to the homepage. So the homepage is right here, this is the525.16525.16 function. And what it does is it renders this home dot html file. So now we go to home dot530.04530.04 html. And in here, we can see that we're extending the base dot html file, which means we're535.28535.28 going to use everything from that. So what we do is we go to base dot html, we say, Okay,539.9599999999999539.9599999999999 this is what base dot html looks like, let's use that. And then it uses that and we get544.56544.56 based on HTML. So now let's try using for example, one. Now before when we used one,551.5999999999999551.5999999999999 what happened was we saw the to do list and the item. Now we're not going to see that556.48556.48 because we haven't programmed that into our HTML. But just notice what happens when I560.2560.2 type slash one. query does not exist. Okay, of course, it doesn't exist. Anyways, just567.76567.76 pretend like that popped up. I'm now I'm frustrated why that didn't work. Because we the to do573.44573.44 list, there's no to do list that has ID one, apparently. Hmm, that's interesting. Let's580.44580.44 try two or something and see if that works or zero, because this should really be giving584.82584.82 us something to there we go. Okay, too. So apparently, the object we have in there has590.1600000000001590.1600000000001 ID two. So anyways, now that we have some objects, we have ID two, you can see that595.36595.36 again, it's showing this base template, because we're rendering the base dot html template600.48600.48 from our index view. And when we went to URLs, we type some numbers. So we went to index604.88604.88 and we passed in the ID as that number that we typed into the address bar. Perfect. That610.6400000000001610.64 is literally how templates work in terms of rendering them. Now it's time to show how615.12615.12 we can make some dynamic templates that I'll actually change based on what you're typing.621.3199999999999621.3199999999999 So obviously, right now, so this one's rendering our base dot html, this one's rendering home626.66626.66 dot html. In previously, we had passed through some value, which was our to do list name,633.48633.48 and we displayed that on the screen. So how can we do that now using templates? Well, inside639.16639.16 of our templates, so this is based on HTML, what we can actually do is we can use some647.0799999999999647.0799999999999 variables that are passed from views. And we can display those in our HTML. So for example,654.0654.0 rather than putting base template here, say I wanted the base template to show all of659.48659.48 our, what do you call it, sorry, our different to do list, then what we can actually do in664.0799999999999664.08 here is we can put two so we can have these open and close curly braces to them. And inside670.76670.76 here, we can type a variable name, and then we will pass that variable in from our views.676.5600000000001676.5600000000001 So for example, if I want the to do list name, maybe I'll pass that in as the variable name.682.2682.2 So I'm going to put name here now. What this means is we're going to be using a variable686.46686.46 called name. Now what I need to do is I go inside views dot pi, and I say, Okay, so we're692.94692.94 using a variable name, we need to give that variable to our view. To do that, we use these698.5600000000001698.5600000000001 right here, this dictionary. So we are going to type the corresponding name, so name here,703.7600000000001703.7600000000001 to what we've typed in our HTML. And then we're going to do a colon and put the value708.74708.74 that we want to pass. Whoa, what just happened with my lights? One second, guys, sorry, something713.5600000000001713.5600000000001 just happened. Okay, anyways, um, now what we're gonna do is we're gonna do ls dot name.719.12719.12 So we're gonna say the variable name inside of our base dot html corresponds to ls name.725.72725.72 Now, because we've done that there, we're going to run into an issue in our home one,731.04731.04 because we're looking for some variable name inside our base HTML. But inside our home736.72736.72 HTML file, we're extending base, which means we need to pass that variable as well. So741.2741.2 for right now, I this obviously is not ideal, we're gonna change this in a second, I'm just745.12745.12 gonna put name. And then this case, I'll just say test, just so that we actually get something750.18750.18 that's working. But let's try this out now and see if everything is the same. So if I754.72754.72 run this, now, you can see that instead of showing me nothing, or showing me base template,760.12760.12 it's showing me first list, which is the name of our first list. And if I go to the homepage,765.36765.36 you can see that we just get tests, because that's what we've passed in as a variable.769.98769.98 So that's really the easy way to pass variables is through this dictionary here. And it's774.78774.78 nice because you don't actually have to type the dictionary here. Like you can make like779.1779.1 my underscore dict equals, and then you can update it with a for loop, or you can pass784.5784.5 a ton of different stuff into this dictionary, and then just put for example, my underscore790.3199999999999790.3199999999999 dict here, and it'll work the exact same way. Okay, so now we've done that, we've kind of795.8795.8 understood how this works. Now, let's go back in templates and talk about some more advanced800.3199999999999800.32 stuff that we can do. So for example, ideally, we've kind of messed this up a little bit805.4000000000001805.4000000000001 because inside of our base HTML, we're displaying, what do you call it, the name of our to do812.08812.08 list, we probably don't want to do that, because on our homepage, we probably want to say something817.08817.08 else, right? Or we just our base page probably shouldn't do that. So what I'm actually going821.86821.86 to do inside here is I'm going to set up what's known as a content block, which can be over828.4000000000001828.4 road from other templates. And you'll see how this works in a second. So if I just do833.36833.36 my 2% signs here, I'm going to type the word block, and then give it a name. So in this838.4838.4 case, I won't do name, I'll do block content. And then what I'm going to do under here is844.36844.36 I'm going to do two signs like this. And I'm going to say, block, or sorry, and block.851.3199999999999851.3199999999999 Okay, now just for good practice, I will put this inside of a div. So I'm just gonna say856.04856.04 div, and I'll say ID equals, in this case, content, and then name equals content, just863.56863.56 in case I want to reference this later, we'll do that. And we'll just end the div here.869.0799999999999869.0799999999999 So tab that in. And now what I'm able to do actually, is from inside my other templates874.8874.8 that extend this template, I can pick what's going to go inside of this block. So for example,880.8880.8 the web titles always going to be the same. But if I want to put something specific inside885.3199999999999885.32 here, depending on what webpage you're on, I can do that from other templates. So on889.5600000000001889.5600000000001 home, for example, I probably want to say like homepage or something like that. So to894.0894.0 do this, I'm going to do a very similar thing to what I've done here, I'm literally just898.88898.88 going to type the same thing and say block content, okay, and then I'm going to close903.72903.72 the block like this by saying and block. And inside here, I'm going to put a parrot or909.5200000000001909.52 actually I'll put an h1 tag. And I'll just simply say, we call it home page like this,916.3199999999999916.3199999999999 okay. So now I'm just gonna go in views, and I'm going to remove this, these variables920.42920.42 from here, because we don't need them anymore. And let's run this now and see what we're924.3199999999999924.3199999999999 getting. So on the homepage, if I hit enter, you can see now we're getting homepage. So929.76929.76 what we've done is we've said, Okay, so this is our base template, the content for each935.36935.36 of the pages that inherit this is going to go inside of this block content. So if I go940.42940.42 here, and I type block content, I can put whatever I want here. And it's just going944.8000000000001944.8000000000001 to paste it inside of here for me. Now, this works the same with other kinds of blocks,950.02950.02 you can create more than one block. And you can choose whether you want to use them or953.6800000000001953.6800000000001 not. So for example, if I want the title to be different, what I can do is inside of here,959.32959.32 and there's no really limit on how you use the blocks, you can use them however you want,963.28963.28 I can say block title. And then here, I can end this block again. And you always have969.16969.16 to end your blocks, you can't just leave them open, otherwise, you're gonna run into some972.68972.68 issues, you end block, and then I can set a default title in here, if I wanted to, for977.0799999999999977.0799999999999 example, Tim's site like that. And then here, I can make this block again. So if I I'll984.0984.0 just copy this actually, and paste it up here and name this title, and then here, I can991.04991.04 just name it whatever I want. So in this case, I'll just say home. Okay, so now what's going995.18995.18 to happen is this block title is going to be again, overridden by this. And it's going999.88999.88 to put that as the title of our webpage, let's try this out. And you can see that now up1004.31999999999991004.3199999999999 here at the top, it's changed to home as opposed to Tim site. Now if I go to like slash two,1010.71999999999991010.7199999999999 you can see there's nothing here just because I haven't set any base stuff to show up inside1015.761015.76 of my base content. If I wanted something default to show up, what I would do is just1021.21021.2 type like hello or something in here, and then that would show up. But that's how the1024.741024.74 blocks work. And that's the first step to kind of template inheritance. Now I'm going1029.721029.72 to show you how we can actually write code inside of our templates to do things more1034.721034.72 dynamically. So this base dot html file is fine, this home file is fine. But I actually1040.721040.72 don't want to be using this base dot html file inside of my as one of my views, I just1047.321047.32 want to inherit from it, and then customize it from each individual view. So what I'm1051.521051.52 going to do is create another view, or another template, my bad, sorry. And I'm going to1055.921055.92 call this file new file. And we will call this one. I should we call it view, I want1063.36000000000011063.3600000000001 to view the to do list. So maybe we'll just call it like list like that, okay, list dot1067.641067.64 html. And what this is going to do is display our to do list for us. So the name of this1073.241073.24 to do list, and then each item on the to do list, it's going to display that in a list1076.56000000000021076.5600000000002 form, that's what I want to do. So I have to start by extending from my base dot html.1082.71082.7 So really simple again, extends in quotes, I don't think it matters if it's single or1087.32000000000021087.3200000000002 double quotes. And then we'll say main or based on HTML, like that, we'll set up our1093.761093.76 blocks. So our first block is going to be the title block. So my percent signs, so block,1101.441101.44 title, and then here we'll go and block like that, then inside here, which our title be,1109.721109.72 maybe we'll just say like, view, view list or something, we could change that later if1114.361114.36 we want. And then we'll set up our content block, which will be actually displaying the1118.321118.32 list for us. So block content, and then inside here, we will obviously end the block. And1128.01128.0 then inside of the content, what I'm going to do now is start working with some variables1132.521132.52 that we pass in from views. So actually, the only thing we really need, I guess, is we1138.041138.04 can say, LS is LS. And then from there, we can determine if we want the name here, if1146.081146.08 we want the items, we can do all that kind of stuff. So let's start by just doing an1150.61150.6 h1 tag, which is the name of the list. So to do this, I'm going to do h1. And then in1155.841155.84 here, we'll, we'll put remember our two curly brace sets. And we're gonna say LS dot name,1162.19999999999981162.1999999999998 okay, because we're passing that LS object. So we can call any methods on it that we want1166.63999999999991166.6399999999999 inside here. So we have the name now. But we also want all of the items. And here's1171.13999999999991171.1399999999999 where things get a bit tricky, kind of tricky, but actually just really cool, and how they1176.01176.0 work. So we could technically have infinite items, we don't know how many items we're1180.561180.56 going to have. So we need to loop through all of the items and then display them in1184.721184.72 kind of a list form. So to do this, we're now going to start actually writing some code,1190.961190.96 some Python code, Python ish code inside of our HTML file. So I'm going to write a for1195.681195.68 loop, I'm going to show you how to do this for loop inside of your templates, you're1200.681200.68 going to start by literally just typing the four. So you can say for and in this case,1205.721205.72 I'm going to say item in LS dot and then item underscore set.all. Now, some of you might1214.081214.08 think you need brackets here. For some reason, when you put the brackets, you run into an1218.321218.32 issue. So if you're going to be looping through something, don't put the brackets like that,1222.921222.92 just leave it like this. And it should work. So if you're running into an issue that says1226.481226.48 something like it can't decipher these brackets, just get rid of them. And that should work1230.281230.28 for you. That's an issue that I was running into. We need to also end this for loop. So1235.241235.24 I'm just going to type n four here. And now inside of here, I'm going to show you what1239.41239.4 we do to display a ton of different items using a loop. So essentially, I mean, maybe1245.61245.6 just we'll indent this to be a bit nicer. Inside this for loop, I want every time this1251.381251.38 for loops runs to get the name of my item and display it on the screen. So to do that,1257.21257.2 I'm going to set up a list. So I think what I do is I do ul I haven't done HTML for a1262.441262.44 while. So this could be a little bit rusty, do ul, which stands for our list, okay. And1268.641268.64 then inside here, what I'm going to do is I'm going to say li like this, we'll end that1274.41274.4 li tag. And then in here, we're gonna use a variable, but our variable this time is1278.721278.72 going to be item dot text, okay, because we're going to get the item, which is that item1284.881284.88 object in our database from the item set of our list. And then we'll display that as a1289.521289.52 list item. Now, I don't even know if I have any items in my list. So we might have to1296.281296.28 add those in a second. But that's fine, we can deal with that when we get to it. So now1300.561300.56 that we've saved this, let's make sure that we're actually going to return list dot HTML1305.041305.04 from our views. So instead of returning base, let's change this to list. And then let's1311.681311.68 run our site here quickly. Okay, so we get first list, and we don't we're not running1316.841316.84 into any issues. But I'm pretty sure the reason we're not seeing all of the different items1321.241321.24 is because we don't have any. So if I want to add some, let's end this. And let's add1324.95999999999981324.9599999999998 some items to that list. So I guess to do this, now I get to refresh my memory is we're1330.361330.36 gonna do a Python managed.pi shell. And then I need to import from my database. So from1338.15999999999991338.16 import main dot models, or is from main dot models. From main dot models, we'll import1351.241351.24 to do list like that. And then what we're going to do is we're going to say, I guess1357.01357.0 we'll say ls equals to do list dot objects dot get ID equals two, we'll print ls out,1367.60000000000011367.6 we see we get first list. So let's look at the item set quickly. So item underscore set1371.281371.28 dot all, we don't have any. So let's add some in there. So item set dot create. And in this1378.41999999999981378.4199999999998 case, I guess what do we just need, we need a text for that, right? So say text equals1382.39999999999991382.3999999999999 and then in this case, we'll say first item. And I guess we'll do complete equals false.1387.91999999999981387.9199999999998 Okay, so we added that. Let's actually add another item. And we'll call this one. Second1394.63999999999991394.64 item. And while we're at it, let's do a third one. Okay, so now we've done that, we can1401.12000000000011401.1200000000001 get out of this by just typing quit, and then run the server again, and then see if we've1407.04000000000021407.0400000000002 updated our list, let's cross the fingers. There we go. And now all of our list items1412.36000000000011412.3600000000001 are showing up. So first item, second item, third item. And that's how you use a for loop1417.56000000000021417.5600000000002 inside of your templates. And that's really like, look how cool that is, we don't have1421.681421.68 to, we don't have to type a ton of HTML, we just do a for loop, like we would in Python,1426.41426.4 we're very familiar with, and then we can just type whatever we want inside of the for1430.31430.3 loop in terms of HTML, and that'll show up on the screen for us. That's how that works.1435.01435.0 And that's really cool. Now we can also do if statements and else statements and stuff1439.881439.88 like that. So I will now show if statements, it's gonna be this a hard example, actually,1446.56000000000021446.5600000000002 what I can do is say, we'll do another blocking here. And in this case, what we'll do is we1451.521451.52 will only show the item if it's not if it's complete, right? Or if it's not complete,1457.761457.76 because if we're gonna have it complete, we probably shouldn't show it. So first of all,1461.21461.2 I don't know why this is trailing here and get rid of that. And in here, I'm now I'm1465.161465.16 just going to do my percent signs again. And I'll say if, and in this case, item dot complete1473.961473.96 equals equals false. And then I will simply end if here, so do percent percent. And if1481.941481.94 like that, so we always have to end our statements, I know it's annoying. But if you think about1486.321486.32 it, we're not really working with indentation in these files. So it's not going to be able1489.761489.76 to tell what's in which statement unless we do an end if, or we less are we end our statements.1494.821494.82 So we need to do that. Okay, so we've done that. And now I will actually just go back1500.01500.0 into the shell again, I know seem pretty counterproductive, and make an item that is actually complete.1505.621505.62 Otherwise, we're not going to see that. So I'm just gonna have to import this again.1510.881510.88 So from main dot models, import to do list, we'll say LS equals to do list dot objects1526.321526.32 dot gets ID equals to k ls dot item underscore set dot create. And then this case, we'll1534.841534.84 say text equals not showing, and then complete equals true. Okay, so true like that, hit1546.281546.28 Enter, not showing, quit that and rerun the server. Probably should have done this before1552.561552.56 guys, but you know, that's fine. So if I run this, now, you can see that we're not seeing1557.71557.7 that item that I just created. But if I change this to be true, okay, and save this now.1565.081565.08 And hopefully this updates quickly. Now you can see that we're only seeing the item that1570.87999999999991570.8799999999999 is complete. So these if statements work just the way they work in Python, you can see only1575.461575.46 the complete items only the not complete items. And yeah, that's really how you do that. We1581.121581.12 can also do like an else and an else if and stuff. So if I want to do an else statement1586.43999999999981586.4399999999998 in here, I can just type else, and then put whatever I want underneath the else. And we1592.121592.12 don't need to type and else, because ending the if will tell us that we're done the entire1597.281597.28 kind of chain statement. So what we'll do actually, and this is kind of interesting1602.15999999999991602.1599999999999 as well is inside of here, we'll do the item dot txt, if it's complete, but we'll do an1607.761607.76 all capitals complete after it, just so we know that it's finished. Otherwise, we will1613.041613.04 say incomplete, like that. So let's try running this now and see if I made any mistakes or1618.841618.84 not. Okay, so there we go. So we can see first item incomplete, second item incomplete, third1622.87999999999991622.8799999999999 item incomplete, not showing complete. Awesome. So that is essentially the basics of templates,1630.761630.76 how we do the kind of inheritance for them. You can obviously have a template inheriting1635.281635.28 a template that inherits another template. And in future videos, we're going to be making1639.21639.2 these look a lot nicer. I just want to give you guys the basics here and make sure everything1643.481643.48 is working. In fact, let me make sure the homepage works. I forget if I showed that.1647.521647.52 Okay, it does.
