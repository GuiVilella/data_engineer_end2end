{"data": "{\"value\":\"0.0 This is a mud, a mud is very rich, and he wants to put that money to good use.6.56.5 So just a few days ago, he presented something called stable diffusion through an initiative12.112.1 that he finances called stability AI stability AI is supposed to be a third pillar.18.7218.72 There's industry, there's academia, and now there's something else.22.58000000000000222.580000000000002 Remember when open AI started and they said they wanted to bring AI to the masses to democratize27.4827.48 the technology and all that kind of stuff.30.1630.16 Well, I'm not wants to do that.31.631.6 But for real.32.632.6 So this is an interview with a mod, he's going to tell us what he wants to achieve with stability37.6837.68 AI, how he plans to go forward so that he's not the only one that's financing this admittedly43.7243.72 very giant operation currently, and what you can do wherever you might be an academic person49.48000000000000449.480000000000004 from industry, or just someone who's interested and wants to do something in the AI space.54.6854.68 And you need some compute, you need some help, you need some time stability AI might be the59.4659.46 place for you.60.4660.46 If you haven't seen the outputs of stable diffusion yet the first system coming out65.065.0 of this initiative, they are absolutely amazing.67.8867.88 And not only that the model is small and fast, it runs on a consumer GPU, and it creates74.1674.16 pictures in about three seconds.76.5276.52 And the model is released open source, fully up to you what to do with it.81.3681.36 Very cool.82.3682.36 So I don't want to stretch this intro too long.84.6684.66 Please listen to what I'm not has to say I'm sure you'll be very interested.88.5288.52 Hey, everyone.89.9289.92 Today, I'm here with a mod mustach, who is, I have to say, I was contacted by mod through98.3298.32 a mutual friend.100.38100.38 And it was very intriguing.102.0102.0 So all I know is that a mod wants to tell us about exciting opportunities, essentially108.14108.14 an alternative in research to bigger labs and big companies doing research a essentially115.28115.28 a third door a third path of people having access to resources to do current deep learning121.34121.34 research amount.122.68122.68 Welcome.123.68123.68 What brings you here?124.68124.68 Hi, Yannick, I think that we're at a super exciting time in artificial intelligence.129.88129.88 Everything seems like it's about to take off.133.0133.0 And I'm here to say, you know, let's all come together and make sure that it gets out to136.96136.96 as many people as possible and we'll unlock all the creativity that people have in front141.6141.6 of them.142.6142.6 So basically, I set up an organization called stability AI, to remove many of the barriers146.68146.68 for independent and academic researchers to build some of these new models that we're152.0152.0 seeing kind of in the early days of Luther AI and lion and others, we heard that computes158.76000000000002158.76000000000002 and kind of funding were a key restriction.162.5162.5 So everyone has basically three choices.165.4165.4 You go into academia, you don't have compute access, and then you have to jump to big tech.170.6170.6 And then you have 59 page MBAs.172.92000000000002172.92000000000002 And you're working in a corporate environment for product teams, or you have your own startup176.96176.96 and running your own startup is terrible.179.56179.56 And it's not something for most academics, or researchers, although of course, some of183.28183.28 them will hopefully be very successful doing legal AI and things like that.189.16189.16 I thought there was going to be a better way because this type of technology that we're192.32192.32 seeing 80% of research dollars is going into next generation AI.198.07999999999998198.07999999999998 And it really has the potential to improve humanity.201.07999999999998201.07999999999998 And so that's why with stability AI, basically, we said, can we solve compute?204.51999999999998204.51999999999998 Can we solve funding?205.88205.88 And can we bring people together to build cool stuff?208.84208.84 And we've actually achieved and managed that when we go live on the 8th of August.213.16213.16 And then this will be before or after, I think, hopefully after it will be revealed, but I'm217.56217.56 happy to discuss everything that we've done to date to address these and what's coming221.44221.44 down the pipeline.222.44222.44 So you say solve compute, solve funding essentially means money.228.64228.64 So stability AI, what's the source of funding or what's the money flow into this organization?236.24236.24 And how is that money spent?237.76237.76 So initially, it was primarily my funding.241.02241.02 So I was lucky enough to have a good career as a hedge fund manager.244.28244.28 Then in 2020-2021, I led the collective augmented intelligence against COVID-19 initiative launch251.12251.12 at Stanford to use the COVID-19 data sets and the backing of the WHO, UNESCO and World256.48256.48 Bank to organize the world's COVID knowledge and make it understandable.261.52261.52 So I've gotten lots of connections.262.82262.82 So I pulled them together, primarily my own kind of funding.265.84000000000003265.84000000000003 And basically, what we've done is we've got a 4000 A100 cluster for open source artificial271.96271.96 intelligence with the support of Amazon, but no control by them.277.18277.18 So that ranks above Jules Booster as potentially the 10th fastest public supercomputer.283.32283.32 And Eleuther AI and Lyon have been basically building on top of that some of the most cool289.44289.44 models that I've ever seen that are about to be released across modalities.293.04293.04 I was about to say, so we've done this as a community to date.297.72297.72 The next stage is even more exciting.299.48299.48 We're partnering up with countries and leading institutions to take this to the next level.304.76304.76 Far more compute, far more funding, and most of all coordination.308.92308.92 So that again, intelligence and creativity can be unlocked to build systems, both for314.96314.96 countries, communities and for humanity that are open and not closed.320.48320.48 Is there a comparison to maybe something that exists?324.64324.64 Could it be compared to something like CERN or the International Space Station?329.06329.06 What is it that you're aiming for when you say we're going for countries, we're going332.15999999999997332.15999999999997 for collaboration?333.62333.62 So we're already partnered with the United Nations.335.68335.68 We're doing national level partnerships with, for example, leading groups and institutions341.42341.42 from India to Singapore to others, from universities to leading media and conglomerates, telcos,347.92347.92 the governments themselves to build national level models and datasets.352.4352.4 So we have the plurality of being around this.357.36357.36 We kicked it off as CERN, but from a Discord group, probably through AI.361.8361.8 And then it evolved into LION, OpenBioML and a bunch of these others bringing together365.88365.88 really talented researchers.367.8367.8 And then my and my team's responsibility was to get them the resources they needed to unlock371.76371.76 this.372.76372.76 The next stage is a bit more institutional, but we really hope it keeps this kind of community376.40000000000003376.40000000000003 vibe that we've got and this community structure that we built.380.96000000000004380.96000000000004 Community vibe, I think is a good keyword.384.38384.38 There are people who just come forward by themselves who want to build things who are389.0389.0 quite clearly engaged, a lot of people in the Luther AI, also people from LION.395.52395.52 Yet when it, I think, gets more public that there is a lot of money, that there is, you401.56401.56 know, funding, compute and so on, there is potentially going to be an influx of a lot407.68407.68 of people with a lot of ideas and promises.410.48410.48 How do you select who gets access to your resources and what can be done with it?417.34417.34 So currently I am GPU emperor.419.79999999999995419.79999999999995 So kind of I decide which projects and things go forward.423.91999999999996423.91999999999996 That's not sustainable.425.26425.26 So instead, what we're doing is we're, again, without trying to kill the vibe of places430.0430.0 like a Luther, LION, OpenBioML and other communities that we've got coming for audio434.55999999999995434.55999999999995 and contrastive learning, robotics, etc.438.4438.4 Set up processes by which grants can be given quickly for small research.443.0443.0 And then we can really think about what the bigger runs and things like that are all about.447.32447.32 With a focus and a mission of, you know, what's cool and what's useful for humanity.453.88453.88 Stability AI itself, on the other side, you know, we are kind of commercializing these.457.59999999999997457.59999999999997 We are a for-profit entity, but with a mission-based thing, so a benefit corporation.463.71999999999997463.71999999999997 And that will inform some of it, but not all of it.467.03999999999996467.03999999999996 So it's this balance of how do you have R&D and academic and independent, and then how471.6471.6 do you productize that so it gets to a billion people?474.36474.36 And we've got a very interesting case study that K-cracks next week around that.478.48478.48 And I'll have to discuss with stable diffusion.481.92481.92 What is stable diffusion?484.28000000000003484.28000000000003 Stable diffusion is the last of this series of kind of diffusion models.488.68488.68 It's the one that basically breaks through on quality, speed and cost to enable anyone495.18495.18 to create images.496.28000000000003496.28000000000003 So DALY 2 was a fantastic experience.499.26499.26 Stable diffusion is about 30 times more efficient and runs on a consumer graphics card.503.28000000000003503.28 For DALY 2 level image quality.505.76505.76 So this was a combination of various groups, such as Conviz from Heidelberg, who came up509.88509.88 with VQGAN and latent diffusion.512.64512.64 Our lead generator of AI coder, Catherine Krausen, Rivers Have Wings, kind of a whole517.64517.64 range of other kind of famous characters within the community to say, how can we build an522.24522.24 efficient model that can scale to a billion people to enable them to be creative?526.8526.8 And so that release is touch wood on the 8th or 9th of August.530.92530.92 And we'll be releasing an open source along with instructions how to run it locally in534.8399999999999534.8399999999999 the cloud and others.536.12536.12 So what we've got is, you know, dream, you see some Galgades there, right?542.52542.52 Tesla roads on the streets of where are you Yannick?547.68547.68 Zurich, Switzerland.550.7199999999999550.7199999999999 Streets of Zurich, right?553.12553.12 You don't even need to dream that up.554.68554.68 The streets here are filled with Teslas.557.0799999999999557.0799999999999 They're filled with Teslas, right?560.5999999999999560.6 Actually kind of DALY 2 is, sorry, my internet's a bit slow.567.24567.24 Maybe we'll redo this demo with faster internet.570.36570.36 Basically, this generates images in about three seconds on five gigabytes of VRAM.575.32575.32 Whereas other image models required like 40 gigabytes or 20 gigabytes of VRAM and they're580.9200000000001580.9200000000001 super slow.581.9200000000001581.9200000000001 So now it's my internet that's actually slower than the actual box.584.8000000000001584.8000000000001 So maybe we'll redo that demo in a bit.588.9200000000001588.92 Oh, there we see it's coming.590.4799999999999590.4799999999999 So I'm on dial up right now it seems.595.06595.06 That gives me nostalgia feelings I have to say.598.24598.24 The line by line rendering of images.600.52600.52 The line by line rendering of images.603.52603.52 Exactly.604.52604.52 It's pretty fun.605.52605.52 If you're watching this and you're younger than 25, this is what the internet was like610.0799999999999610.0799999999999 in the early days.611.0799999999999611.0799999999999 That's an internet.612.0799999999999612.0799999999999 So there you got your lovely Tesla in Zurich, right?615.24615.24 Cool.616.24616.24 This is an image model that we built off Lion 5B.619.36619.36 The Lion guys were obviously here a while ago, very close kind of working with us.623.5600000000001623.5600000000001 Some of them are actually stability employees as well.626.72626.72 Taking that 250 terabytes of data, we can press it down to two gigabytes via this diffusion631.24631.24 model type of thing.633.12633.12 By the time this goes out, probably everyone will be able to play with it locally or in637.88637.88 the cloud, et cetera.638.88638.88 Because we really want to unlock this wave of innovation.642.28642.28 Because I think that's how it happens.644.72644.72 I don't know if Aluth has made the announcement yet, but GPT Neo and GPT Neo X and J have649.64649.64 been downloaded 25 million times now by developers.653.5600000000001653.5600000000001 That can really catalyze ecosystems for development against the more, shall we say, paternalistic659.52659.52 instincts of some of the bigger AI players who refuse to release images, model the code665.64665.64 or the weights.666.64666.64 Stable diffusion is a very interesting one.670.28670.28 Because we could have kept it closed source.672.84672.84 It's a step forward.673.84673.84 It's 30 times more efficient than DALY 2.675.32675.32 You can have comparable image quality and you saw the raw output.680.4680.4 But why would you if you can instead make it go from millions of people using this technology685.12685.12 to billions of people using this technology?687.52687.52 That's far more interesting.688.52688.52 Again, I think it's the type of thing we need to do, make this technology really usable.692.64692.64 Don't think 175 billion parameter language models or 540 billion parameters models are698.72698.72 really usable for the vast majority of humanity.702.52702.52 You mentioned this open source, closed source, paternalistic and so on.705.84705.84 I agree there is a paternalistic element, but there's also a PR and a legal element,710.84710.84 right?711.84711.84 If DALY 2 was accessible to everyone and so on, and people find, oh, I just need to enter716.72716.72 this prompt to make it produce something that's really horrible, that may produce a backlash,722.72722.72 right?723.72723.72 Saying, well, these models are clearly not fit for release and so on.727.56727.56 What is your opinion if someone comes to you and says, your model produces horrible output733.76733.76 here I can show you.737.04737.04 What do you say to those people?739.88739.88 I would say, of course, humanity is horrible and they use technology in horrible ways and744.56744.56 good ways as well.746.28746.28 But the reality is, for this particular output, the vast majority of people are creatively750.64750.64 constipated.752.1999999999999752.1999999999999 We have been conditioned to consume constantly by social media and big tech giants.757.4399999999999757.44 They want us to consume more according to their parameters.760.2800000000001760.2800000000001 You see a model like this, we've had three-year-olds use it in refugee camps all the way to 90-year-olds.766.84766.84 We're putting it in mental health settings and other things.770.0770.0 The benefits far outweigh any negativity.772.2772.2 The reality is that people need to get used to these models.774.9200000000001774.9200000000001 They're coming one way or another.777.8000000000001777.8000000000001 And restricting them means that you become the arbiter.780.8800000000001780.8800000000001 As an example, we took some programmers out of Russia because they spoke out against the786.7600000000001786.76 government there.789.08789.08 And some came from the Ukraine as well and we fast-tracked their residency in the UK.794.84794.84 You can't use the word Ukraine in DALY 2 because it's political.800.6800.6 Then as well, if you type in sumo wrestler, they randomly added to the prompts because804.08804.08 they do pre-prompt and post-prompt processing a diversity filter.808.3199999999999808.3199999999999 So you get Asian female sumo wrestlers because they randomly add ethnicities.812.48812.48 There's nothing you can do about that.814.8199999999999814.82 If you want to create a localized version that is more respective to your culture, for819.5600000000001819.5600000000001 example in India, you can't do that because you can't access the model.823.6400000000001823.6400000000001 And they don't have the capacity to let you find a unit.826.48826.48 So instead, what they're saying is AI for us and our clients because it's expensive831.0400000000001831.0400000000001 to run these things, not for everyone else.834.48834.48 What they're really saying is we don't trust you as humanity because we know better.838.84838.84 I think that's wrong.840.4000000000001840.4000000000001 I actually trust people.841.98841.98 I trust them to be weird and nasty in some cases, because 1%, 0.1% of people are weird.847.64847.64 Many people on this call are weird.848.96848.96 I'm weird.849.96849.96 But at the same time, like I said, I think that this is positive technology for humanity853.8000000000001853.8000000000001 and it should diffuse because then the pace of innovation to make it beneficial as well857.86857.86 as to combat negative uses is far greater.861.24861.24 You previously said stability AI employee.865.04865.04 So not only do you give grants in terms of hardware and what to run, you do pay people871.28871.28 to actually work part time or full time.874.0874.0 Can you specify a little bit of what just being an employee at stability AI means?880.16880.16 Yeah.881.16881.16 So different people need different things.883.24883.24 We come from all diverse backgrounds.884.9599999999999884.9599999999999 Some of them needed the equivalent to their jobs at Google or Microsoft when they left.889.3199999999999889.3199999999999 So we pay competitive salaries, high bonuses, and in our contracts, no IP.894.8399999999999894.8399999999999 All the work can be open sourced by any developer.897.6897.6 Similarly, we have set it up.899.3899.3 So as we run APIs and our models, there's a revenue share for all developers, even if903.64903.64 they don't work at stability, who created the models.906.64906.64 So 10% of revenue goes to this pool, half of which goes to the creators of the models910.7199999999999910.7199999999999 and data sets, and half of which goes to a communal pool where everyone involved in stability915.3199999999999915.3199999999999 as an employee or otherwise, which I'll come to in a second, basically awards it to the919.4799999999999919.4799999999999 most interesting research so that you can actually have a career from doing interesting925.4925.4 research by open source.926.4926.4 It doesn't have to be commercial.928.5999999999999928.6 So the commercial is the running the APIs, the non-commercial is the other 5% of revenue.933.36933.36 We also do fellowships.935.88935.88 So we're sponsoring a whole bunch of coders such as Lucid Rain, Scott Wang through GitHub940.28940.28 sponsors and we ask, what do you need to be comfortable?943.12943.12 We're going to fund 100 PhDs in AI over the next year.946.6946.6 And that comes with a huge for academia, small and large as well.950.12950.12 And we hope that will be a community within our communities and across communities that953.64953.64 can coordinate global academic research.955.96955.96 And we support as well.957.76957.76 So for example, we have mental health support, we have grant writers, we have paper writers961.84961.84 and other things just to enable people to get on with what's interesting and be able966.16966.16 to build in the open.967.84967.84 We haven't been in the open until now because we've been building and also because it's970.76970.76 quite fun to announce and release all this.974.18974.18 But we hope that we can actually build in the open and change some of these incentive977.0977.0 structures by unlocking people, be it grants, be it fellowships, be it PhD funding, be it982.4399999999999982.4399999999999 part-time jobs, full-time jobs, or just being members of the community and getting prizes986.92986.92 from this kind of pool that will hopefully become very large.990.4799999999999990.4799999999999 We also have a charity as well.992.04992.04 That's where the PhD funding comes from.995.0799999999999995.0799999999999 So charitable arm.997.4799999999999997.4799999999999 What keeps you from becoming like going the same route as let's say OpenAI, any, all these1006.641006.64 companies from DeepMind, they have it, you know, we want to make AI for everyone.1012.43999999999991012.4399999999999 They've been for profit and very close from the beginning.1015.281015.28 OpenAI actually started out with, we want to democratize.1018.43999999999991018.4399999999999 We want everyone to be accessible to give us money and we know what's good for you,1023.83999999999991023.8399999999999 right?1024.841024.84 What keeps you like there's clearly a pull, right?1027.921027.92 There's clearly demands coming with any money that flows in.1032.63999999999991032.6399999999999 It's clearly attractive to sort of keep your, let's say leading position to attract more1038.241038.24 researchers and so on.1040.041040.04 How do you prevent yourself from, let's say, succumbing to that pull of going close to1046.481046.48 or going profit?1047.481047.48 Well, I think it, you know, OpenAI, one of the founders who's left, I won't mention on1052.841052.84 this call, maybe we can mention privately said that kind of what we're creating is what1056.39999999999991056.3999999999999 he wants to do when OpenAI was founded.1059.01059.0 It was just the wrong time.1060.441060.44 So obviously, you know, they had to scale up compute because you have this kind of stack1063.921063.92 more layers type thing.1066.61066.6 And then all the issues that happened in 2019, the on-musk, et cetera, that basically led1070.121070.12 to a bailout and then a change in the entire corporate structure.1074.43999999999981074.4399999999998 And then a change in focus to become more productized, even though they're not actually1077.63999999999991077.6399999999999 product focused.1078.63999999999991078.6399999999999 DeepMind had a bit of a different kind of thing.1081.15999999999991081.1599999999999 But again, they were the wrong time because what you've seen is these models have lots1084.321084.32 of promise and they're powerful, but they haven't had that technological diffusion curve,1088.361088.36 right?1089.361089.36 What is the killer app?1090.67999999999981090.6799999999998 Natural language processing and kind of these large language models.1094.121094.12 They were tackling a problem I think was already 85% to 90% solved.1098.041098.04 And now we've gone to 95% solved.1100.321100.32 And they're large and bulky.1102.521102.52 Image I think is the killer app.1104.121104.12 Because when you look at this, it's a wonder for people that they can suddenly create rather1108.041108.04 than consume.1109.71999999999981109.7199999999998 And that's something that's across the board.1111.541111.54 You know, the comparators are Snapchat or TikTok, where you can create.1114.91999999999981114.9199999999998 There's Pokemon Go, you know, Gacha games and these kinds of things.1118.15999999999991118.1599999999999 But it'll be integrated into so many different areas that it's got fast enough, cheap enough1122.23999999999981122.2399999999998 and good enough.1123.23999999999981123.24 And like I said, this model file that we're releasing only a couple of gigabytes.1127.241127.24 You know, it can fit on eight gigabytes of VRAM.1129.281129.28 That's crazy.1130.281130.28 You know, there'll be bigger models and better models like Imogen, but this inflection point1134.841134.84 is what makes our business sustainable.1136.881136.88 It allows us to do things like say, you can work just for open source to our employees.1142.01142.0 It allows us to do things like revenue share, where we'll be able to attract the best employees.1145.641145.64 Because if you believe this is going to a billion people, you'll have more than that.1149.041149.04 And then finally, the structure that we've employed is kind of one whereby we're partnering1153.741153.74 with various kind of governments and leading institutions so that we build AI for each1158.921158.92 nation and communities in each nation.1161.281161.28 So we capture that cultural diversity.1163.321163.32 So again, it's very community focused.1165.01165.0 It's very oriented.1166.01166.0 There's a good business model.1167.721167.72 We've negotiated massive deals so we can be profitable at the door versus most money losing1172.241172.24 big corporations.1173.241173.24 There's a few extra things in there that I can't discuss right now.1177.281177.28 But we really kind of laid it out to be the right company at the right time to coordinate1180.61180.6 this all.1181.61181.6 And then hopefully, as this goes, this becomes an independent, more decentralized thing.1186.121186.12 Originally, we wanted to be web3 with tokens and all that, but you don't need that.1190.161190.16 You know, you just need to have a good community that keeps you in check.1192.61192.6 And you need to build in the open and do things in the open, which I hope we'll manage to1195.961195.96 do over the next year.1198.081198.08 How can people find you?1200.81200.8 How can people find your models and work with your stuff?1203.781203.78 And how can people who are maybe interested in taking part in the community and contributing1209.441209.44 in some way find you?1212.421212.42 So we have our website stability AI that will be updated when we launch publicly next week.1217.561217.56 You know, join our communities at a Luther AI or Lyon or others that we're going to accelerate1222.21222.2 and really, you know, put a lot more structure around.1226.39999999999991226.3999999999999 Open Biomail, Harmoni for Music, Carp for Contrastive Learning, you know, we've got1230.841230.84 education and many other things coming down the pipeline.1233.91999999999981233.9199999999998 Yeah, and I think it's just community based.1236.241236.24 Be active in the community, you will get rewarded with, you know, money and status and all sorts1240.321240.32 of other things.1241.321241.32 We do interesting stuff.1242.321242.32 You want to join stability, there are roles for exceptional programmers to come and help1246.31246.3 coordinate this.1247.31247.3 You want your PhD funded, we will announce the PhD funding program in a couple of months.1252.67999999999981252.6799999999998 You want to tell us how to do this properly, open to advice.1256.521256.52 You know, like, I don't think we have all the answers, but I hope we're kind of getting1259.81259.8 there and I think certainly will make a difference through this really flexible supercomputer1263.81263.8 cluster, if nothing else.1265.15999999999991265.1599999999999 Again, it's a big, big cluster.1268.01268.0 And it's available for the coolest research that can make an impact on humanity.1272.21272.2 And we'll get more, we have far bigger supercomputers lined up as well.1276.91999999999981276.9199999999998 So I think that's super exciting.1278.39999999999991278.3999999999999 What is the type of person that you're looking for in a contributor?1282.521282.52 And what is maybe a type of person that you're not looking for?1286.81286.8 So the type of person we're looking for a contributor are those that believe in open1290.241290.24 source AI and not open source energy, but open source innovation.1294.761294.76 You know, like we're bringing this technology to make humanity better.1297.961297.96 You can make profits, that's fine, right?1299.481299.48 But I think it should be secondary to just, is this going to make a difference?1303.281303.28 You know, I don't mind if people are corporate, et cetera, but it needs to be people that1306.81306.8 integrate with the community, can work well with people from a whole bunch of different1310.081310.08 backgrounds and just are generally inquisitive, that want to push the boundaries.1314.441314.44 I think some of the biggest breakthroughs we've had have been from non-traditional backgrounds.1318.521318.52 You know, I don't know if you've interviewed the Eleuther AI founders, none of them have1322.01322.0 a computer science degree, you know?1324.761324.76 And yet they kind of managed to achieve such great things.1326.961326.96 Now obviously there's conjecture for alignment and we're pushing some of the capability stuff1330.84000000000011330.8400000000001 there.1331.84000000000011331.8400000000001 So, you know, I think what we don't want to see is just people who are just highly corporatized,1336.681336.68 kind of stuck in one way of thinking and want to see how to make a quick buck out of all1340.961340.96 of this.1341.961341.96 You can make money, but so what?1343.921343.92 We're at this pivotal point where this technology can maximize humanity's potential or it can1348.761348.76 be corporatized and be used as a method of centralization and control.1352.641352.64 Which side do you want to be on?1354.641354.64 Yeah.1355.641355.64 Now you can make money on both sides.1359.60000000000011359.6000000000001 Is there anything else that you want to get out to people that you want to let people1364.36000000000011364.3600000000001 know that we haven't talked about yet?1365.961365.96 No, I mean, like I said, we've got an amazing pipeline and roadmap that we have to put out1370.41370.4 with them, so, you know, work on everything from audio diffusion, video diffusion, 3D.1374.56000000000021374.5600000000002 I mean, I think in particular, if people want to try and create the metaverse, the Ready1378.481378.48 Player One one minus the microtransaction or holodeck, we're going to aim to do that.1382.721382.72 And I would say that probably our killer app, the one that I want to make most, and I'd1386.04000000000021386.0400000000002 invite anyone to contact me if they want to build this with me, is I want to destroy PowerPoint.1391.36000000000011391.3600000000001 I think the combination of language, image, kind of contrastive and other models means1395.71395.7 that if we work super hard in a few years, we'll never need to make a slide deck again.1400.12000000000011400.12 Tell the computer, tell it how you want to adjust it, they'll be beautiful each time.1403.67999999999981403.6799999999998 And think about how much happiness will bring to the world that way.1408.01408.0 No more stock images of little drawn people going like, hmm.1414.63999999999991414.6399999999999 Very cool.1415.63999999999991415.6399999999999 Yeah, you know, dragging and dropping little bits on the slides and refining them.1420.361420.36 Tell the computer it'll create the slide deck for you.1423.121423.12 Tell it how you want to adjust it, it'll adjust it.1425.31425.3 So much happiness brought to the world.1427.67999999999981427.68 I think that's another thing as well, like academia, companies, all these things.1433.961433.96 I think too many people in our community are unhappy.1437.241437.24 And obviously, there's a lot of neuro atypical people within our community, right?1441.12000000000011441.1200000000001 I'm neuro atypical myself, you know?1444.161444.16 I want to see how we can have a happier community that supports each other.1447.421447.42 Because otherwise, there are these big highs and lows and things like that.1449.84000000000011449.8400000000001 And I think people focus enough on that.1451.721451.72 That's what I focus on with my engineers and what I'm trying to focus on the community.1455.681455.68 Because then people will be more productive, sure, but they'll also be more content.1459.961459.96 So it sounds a bit fuzzy, but I think it's really important and people don't pay enough1463.36000000000011463.3600000000001 attention to it.1464.36000000000011464.3600000000001 Wise words.1465.36000000000011465.3600000000001 So actually, maybe we should mention one of the projects we have, 7cups.com.1471.62000000000011471.6200000000001 It's something that we help kind of accelerate.1473.481473.48 You can go and you can chat to someone.1474.641474.64 So you don't even have the pressure of talking to someone online who's been trained in active1478.241478.24 listening.1479.241479.24 And we have studies showing it's as effective as taking Prozac, and it's free.1484.32000000000021484.32 And for $150 a month, you can talk to a part-time mental health therapist.1488.67999999999981488.6799999999998 So we've got 468,000 volunteers in 180 countries, helping 80 million people each month.1495.01495.0 So I'd recommend people try that.1496.87999999999991496.8799999999999 And then if anyone wants to help me take that data set, you know, with full privacy and1502.261502.26 everything like that, to create systems that we can better listen and understand each other.1506.321506.32 Again, that's something that I'd be very interested in talking to people, because I really want1510.15999999999991510.1599999999999 to help people help people.1511.81511.8 Awesome.1512.81512.8 Emma, thank you very much for being here.1515.321515.32 Very exciting.1516.321516.32 I'm looking forward to the release next week.1519.61519.6 Maybe it's already out once this is out.1521.91999999999981521.9199999999998 Yeah, thanks a lot for being here.1524.281524.28 And good luck to the Endeavor.1526.961526.96 Thank you very much, Yannick.1527.961527.96 Pleasure.1528.961528.96 Awesome podcast you've had.1529.961529.96 I've enjoyed listening to it.1530.961530.96 Thank you.1531.961531.96 Take care.1541.56\"}"}
